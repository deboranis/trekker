# What is Trekker?

I love yapping about my nerdy little interests, which lead some of my friends to believe watching Star Trek was actually worth it, since I spoke about it so much and with such passion. Trekker was an idea I got after having some of them ask _how_ they should watch Star Trek -- in which order? Should one watch all episodes of all franchises? What about the movies?

I found a great guide that helped me a lot, which is Let's Watch Star Trek. The rating system makes sense, but I do disagree with the creators on many reviews they wrote. So predominanlty I would advise on a specific order and a handful of episodes from each series depending on how much time one would want to spend on it. If they felt like _doing the whole thing_, I'd tell them to use the guide as reference, along with IMDB.

I also mentioned many social, political and economical issues addressed throughout the series, such as LGBTQ+ rights, gender equality, universal health care, unions, cultural shock, prejudice, profit, morality, corporate greed and even life forms that defy everything we know -- which made star Trek, in my opinion, that much more complex and realistic than most sci-fi universes. It stirred a curiosity for which I had not answers, since I don't know each and every episode by heart. I could remember that TNG had a funny episode in a planet where gender stereotypes were swapped, but I couldn't recall it's name or season.

The functionality of tagging episodes by subject made me want to create my own Star Trek guide. One that had my own reviews and a filtering system that could provide both an exploration by subject and do the recommended content math for everyone. 

And this is how we got here. Welcome!

The goal here was for me to train my skills on fullstack development, learning not only how to create reusable templates with a well known component library, but also integration with a database and all the backend stuff.
